  abstract   = {Wireless microphone networks or so-called wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs) are a next-generation technology for audio acquisition and processing. As opposed to traditional microphone arrays that sample a sound field only locally, often at large distances from the relevant sound sources, WASNs allow to use many more microphones to cover a large area of interest. However, the design of such WASNs is very challenging, especially for real-time audio acquisition and signal enhancement due to the significant data traffic in the network. There is a need for scalable solutions, both on the signal processing level and on the network-communication level. In this paper, we give an overview of applications and trends in the field of WASNs, and we address the core challenges that need to be tackled. We mainly focus on the signal processing level, and we explain how advances in the area of signal processing can relax the high-demanding constraints on the network layer design. Furthermore, we address the interaction between the application layer and the network layer, and we explain why cross-layer design can be important to improve the performance of WASN applications.},

The proposed TTM method is analytical (no optimization procedure involved), and it is robust to noise.

The method is based on the construction of the null subspace of the data matrix in the presence of colored noise, using the generalized singular-value decomposition (GSVD) technique, or the generalized eigenvalue decomposition (GEVD) of the respective correlation matrices. The special Silvester structure of the filtering matrix, related to this subspace, is exploited for deriving a total least squares (TLS) estimate for the acoustical transfer functions (ATFs). Other less robust but computationally more efficient methods are derived based on the same structure and on the QR decomposition (QRD). A preliminary study of the incorporation of the subspace method into a subband framework proves to be efficient, although some problems remain open. Speech reconstruction is achieved by virtue of the matched filter beamformer (MFBF). An experimental study supports the potential of the proposed methods.},

The proposed algorithm novelly exploits the affine projection principle to minimize the CR error. As a result, a cost function is minimized that differs from the one used in existing CR based adaptive algorithms. A major advantage of the proposed multichannel affine projection algorithm (MCAPA) is that the affine projection order can be used to control the tradeoff between the rate of convergence and computational complexity. In an experimental study, MCAPA is compared with two recently developed adaptive algorithms, i.e., the low-cost multichannel least-mean-square (MCLMS) and high-performance multichannel Newton (MCN) algorithms. The results show that MCAPA converges faster than MCLMS with a computational complexity that is significantly lower than MCN, thereby increasing the applicability of the CR method.},

A major drawback of the MCN is that it requires the computation and inversion of a Hessian matrix, which involves extensive computation making it unsuitable for online applications. In this paper, we therefore derive and investigate an efficient online multichannel quasiNewton (MCQN) algorithm that updates the inverse of the Hessian by analyzing successive gradient vectors.

The normalized multichannel frequency-domain least-mean-square (NMCFLMS) algorithm was developed to blindly identify a single-input multiple-output acoustic system, which can yield good performance in noise-free environments. However, the robustness of this algorithm to noise has been shown to be problematic. One way to improve the robustness is by applying a constraint on the spectral flatness of the channel impulse responses, which led to the development of the so-called robust normalized multichannel frequency-domain least-mean-square (RNMCFLMS) algorithm. This spectral flatness constraint, however, may not be always proper or reasonable in realistic acoustic environments. In this paper, we develop an {$\mathscr{l}$}p-norm constraint based robust normalized multichannel frequency-domain least-mean-square ({$\mathscr{l}$}p-RNMCFLMS) algorithm. The {$\mathscr{l}$}p-norm constraint is introduced into the NMCFLMS algorithm to control the effect of different {$\mathscr{l}$}p-norm penalties on the adaptive filter for the impulse responses with different degrees of sparseness. Numerical and realistic experiments justify the effectiveness of the proposed {$\mathscr{l}$}p-RNMCFLMS algorithm.},

The goal is to distributively optimize a global objective function over a network of decision makers. The global objective function is composed of convex cost functions associated with each agent. The local cost functions can be broken down into two convex functions, one of which is revealed over time to the decision makers and one known a priori. We extend an online ADMM algorithm to a distributed setting based on dual-averaging. We then explore the rate of convergence of the performance of the sequence of decisions generated by the algorithm to the best fixed decision in hindsight. This performance metric is called regret. An upper bound on the regret of the proposed algorithm is presented as a function of the underlying network topology and linear constraints.

A class of frequency-domain adaptive approaches, including the multichannel frequency-domain LMS (MCFLMS) and constrained/unconstrained normalized multichannel frequency-domain LMS (NMCFLMS) algorithms, are proposed. By utilizing the fast Fourier transform (FFT) and overlap-save techniques, the convolution and correlation operations that are computationally intensive when performed by the time-domain multichannel LMS (MCLMS) or multichannel Newton (MCN) methods are efficiently implemented in the frequency domain, and the MCFLMS is rigorously derived. In order to achieve independent and uniform convergence for each filter coefficient and, therefore, accelerate the overall convergence, the coefficient updates are properly normalized at each iteration, and the NMCFLMS algorithms are developed. Simulations show that the frequency-domain adaptive approaches perform as well as or better than their time-domain counterparts and the cross-relation (CR) batch method in most practical cases. It is remarkable that for a three-channel acoustic system with long impulse responses (256 taps in each channel) excited by a male speech signal, only the proposed NMCFLMS algorithm succeeds in determining a reasonably accurate channel estimate, which is good enough for applications such as time delay estimation.},

  abstract  = {An important prerequisite for acoustic multi-channel equalization for speech dereverberation involves the identification of the acoustic channels between the source and the microphones. Blind System Identification (BSI) algorithms based on cross-relation error minimization are known to mis-converge in the presence of noise. Although algorithms have been proposed in the literature to improve robustness to noise, the estimated room impulse responses are usually constrained to have a flat magnitude spectrum. In this paper, noise robust algorithms based on a Rayleigh quotient cost function are proposed. Unlike the traditional algorithms, the estimated impulse responses are not always forced to have unit norm. Experimental results using simulated room impulse responses and several SNRs show that one of the proposed algorithms outperforms competing algorithms in terms of normalized projection misalignment.},

  abstract  = {Blind multichannel identification has played a crucial role as a prerequisite for channel equalization, speech de-reverberation, and time-delay estimation for decades. Algorithms based on cross-relation (CR) errors have been widely studied, however, these algorithms have been reported to be fundamentally vulnerable to additive noise. Consequently, there have been many studies to improve robustness. Among them, the {$\mathscr{l}$}p-robust normalized multichannel frequency-domain least-mean-square ({$\mathscr{l}$}p-RNMCFLMS) algorithm was developed recently to blindly identify a single-input-multiple-output system in a reverberant environment. However, the additional penalty functions of conventional algorithms including {$\mathscr{l}$}p-RNMCFLMS are based only on the magnitude spectra of the microphone channels. In this work, we propose a new penalty function applied to the phase spectra of the system. Furthermore, we develop an extended {$\mathscr{l}$}p-RNMCFLMS to improve the steady-state performance by discriminating p values on impulse responses separated into significant and insignificant components. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms conventional algorithms even in low-SNR conditions.},

One of the most important methods for single-input multi-output (SIMO) system identification is the distributed subchannel matching (DSCM) algorithm. However, as the DSCM algorithm treats each component of the channel coefficient vectors equally, it has no advantage when the channels are sparse. In this paper, we propose a kind of sparse DSCM algorithms to blindly identify sparse channels based on the measurements from a sensor network. Unlike the common DSCM algorithm, the proposed algorithm incorporates a sparsity-enforcing regularization term, {$\mathscr{l}$}p-norm (p = 0 or 1) into the cost function to exploit the sparse nature of channels. Several simulations are then presented to show that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of channel identification in both convergence and accuracy.},

We introduce new proof techniques for ADM in the batch setting, which yields a O(1/T ) convergence rate for ADM and forms the basis for regret analysis in the online setting. We consider two scenarios in the online setting, based on whether an additional Bregman divergence is needed or not. In both settings, we establish regret bounds for both the objective function as well as constraints violation for general and strongly convex functions. We also consider inexact ADM updates where certain terms are linearized to yield efficient updates and show the stochastic convergence rates. In addition, we briefly discuss that online ADM can be used as projection-free online learning algorithm in some scenarios.

In this paper we extend our recent study on under-modelled BSI from the time domain to the frequency domain, such that the RIRs can be updated frame-wise and the efficiency of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is exploited to reduce the computational complexity. Analogous to the cross-correlation based criterion in the time domain, a frequency-domain cross power spectrum based criterion is proposed. As the early RIRs are usually sparse, the RIRs are estimated by jointly maximizing the cross power spectrum based criterion in the frequency domain and minimizing the l1-norm sparsity measure in the time domain. A two-stage LMS updating algorithm is derived to achieve joint optimization of these two targets.

  abstract = {In multiple speaker scenarios, the linearly constrained minimum variance (LCMV) beamformer is a popular microphone array-based speech enhancement technique, as it allows minimizing the noise power while maintaining a set of desired responses towards different speakers. Here, we address the algorithmic challenges arising when applying the LCMV beamformer in wireless acoustic sensor networks (WASNs), which are a next-generation technology for audio acquisition and processing. We review three optimal distributed LCMV-based algorithms, which compute a network-wide LCMV beamformer output at each node without centralizing the microphone signals. Optimality here refers to equivalence to a centralized realization where a single processor has access to all signals. We derive and motivate the algorithms in an accessible top-down framework that reveals their underlying relations. We explain how their differences result from their different design criterion (node-specific versus common constraints sets), and their different priorities for communication bandwidth, computational power, and adaptivity. Furthermore, although originally proposed for a fully connected WASN, we also explain how to extend the reviewed algorithms to the case of a partially connected WASN, which is assumed to be pruned to a tree topology. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the various algorithms},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of finding a linear iteration that yields distributed averaging consensus over a network, i.e., that asymptotically computes the average of some initial values given at the nodes. When the iteration is assumed symmetric, the problem of finding the fastest converging linear iteration can be cast as a semidefinite program, and therefore efficiently and globally solved. These optimal linear iterations are often substantially faster than several common heuristics that are based on the Laplacian of the associated graph. We show how problem structure can be exploited to speed up interior-point methods for solving the fastest distributed linear iteration problem, for networks with up to a thousand or so edges. We also describe a simple subgradient method that handles far larger problems, with up to 100000 edges. We give several extensions and variations on the basic problem.},
